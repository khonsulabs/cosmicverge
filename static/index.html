        <h1>Cosmic Verge</h1>
        <img src="/prototype.png" class="screencap" />
        <p>On February 13, 2021, a very early prototype of Cosmic Verge was
            shown off at the Rust GameDev Meetup. It was a WASM app written in Rust
            powered by a Rust server.</p>
        <p>The prototype had several limitations worth noting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It relied on PostgreSQL and Redis, both which aren't easy to deploy in a truly highly-available fashion.
            </li>
            <li>The design didn't allow for "load balancing" star systems, which meant that the database clusters would
                become bottlenecks.</li>
            <li>It used WebSockets only, which isn't a great approach for a networked game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a second passionate Rustacean joined, we discussed and debated the design
            of the architecture, aiming to make it highly available, scale well, and
            be affordable.</p>
        <p>The fallout from these discussions is that Cosmic Verge is on hold --
            for now. This page is being served by <a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb">BonsaiDb</a>, the
            database
            engine we're writing to replace PostgreSQL and Redis in this game's
            architecture. If we begin working on Cosmic Verge again, it will be
            built atop <a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/ncog">Ncog</a> -- our
            vision of a programmable, privacy-first communication and collaboration
            platform.</p>
        <p>If our ambitious vision is exciting to you, and you are a Rustacean
            or are looking to learn Rust, we'd love to hear from you on <a href="https://community.khonsulabs.com">our
                forums</a>, <a href="https://discord.khonsulabs.com">our Discord</a>, or via the issues
            tracker on whatever project interests you most.</p>
