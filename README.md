A 2d, persistent multiplayer, single-universe game written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Playable in modern browsers (not Internet Explorer) at [CosmicVerge.com](https://cosmicverge.com)

The game is very early in development, and the initial roadmap is currently being planned.

## Open Source

This game is mostly open source. This entire repository is under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). There is, however, a separate repository containing private assets and eventually private code to keep secrets about the game from the public. The goal is for the majority of the game to remain open source, and I am hoping to end up with all of the assets licensed under a creative commons license.

## Yet Commercial

Eventually, I hope to sustain a living off of my open source development, and this game is part of those plans. The exact pricing model hasn't been set, but the goal for it is to be subscription based with a free-to-play tier, and no additional in-game monetization.

## About the Development

This is a full-time passion project of [mine](https://github.com/ecton). The other open-source projects that I wrote that support this game are:

- [![basws](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/khonsulabs/basws?label=basws)](https://github.com/khonsulabs/basws) A websocket API framework that makes it easy to use any [serde](https://lib.rs/serde)-compatible data type as the Request and Response types. Includes a [warp](https://lib.rs/warp) server, a [tokio](https://tokio.rs)-based native client, and a [yew](https://yew.rs)-based [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) client
- [![KhonsuBase](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/khonsulabs/khonsubase?label=khonsubase)](https://github.com/khonsulabs/khonsubase) A project management tool written using [rocket](https://rocket.rs)
- [![yew-bulma](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/khonsulabs/yew-bulma?label=yew-bulma)](https://github.com/khonsulabs/yew-bulma) A set of [bulma](https://bulma.io)-compatible [yew](https://yew.rs) components
- [![sqlx-simple-migrator](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/khonsulabs/sqlx-simple-migrator?label=sqlx-simple-migrator)](https://github.com/khonsulabs/sqlx-simple-migrator) A simple database migrator for [sqlx](https://lib.rs/sqlx). I began using sqlx before it supported migrations, and I prefer my style over the built-in ones. Used for both [this game](./native/migrations) and [khonsubase](https://github.com/khonsulabs/khonsubase)

## Running the code

### Databases

The server currently needs two database servers running: [Redis](https://redis.io) and [Postgres](https://postgresql.org).

Once Redis is running, it needs no extra configuration. For Postgres, you need a database and a user that can connect to it. If you'd prefer to not use the default username, you can create a new one like this:

```sql
CREATE ROLE cosmicuser LOGIN PASSWORD '***';
CREATE DATABASE cosmicverge OWNER cosmicuser;
```

### Twitch OAuth

To be able to authenticate with Twitch, you will need to create an OAuth Application on the [Twitch Developer's site](https://dev.twitch.tv/).

For the callback URL, specify `http://localhost:7879/v1/auth/callback/twitch`

Save the client ID and secret for use in the .env file below.

### Example `.env` file

To configure your environment, place a file named `.env` in the root of the repository.

```ini
DATABASE_URL="postgres://cosmicuser:***@localhost/cosmicverge"
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="***"
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="***"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Installing required build tools

- [cargo-make](https://lib.rs/cargo-make): `cargo install cargo-make`
- [wasm-bindgen-cli](https://lib.rs/wasm-bindgen-cli): `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/): `npm install -g sass` (there are alternative installation methods)
- [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen): Installation methods vary by platform. You'll need to ensure that `wasm-opt` is available in the `PATH` on your system.

### Useful Build Commands

To build the web application:

```bash
cd web
cargo make build
```

To "watch" and automatically rebuild the web application (requires [cargo-watch](https://lib.rs/cargo-watch)):

```bash
cd web
cargo make watch
```

To run the database migrations (required to build the server):

```bash
cd native
cargo run --bin migrator
```

To generate static assets that are procedurally generated:

```bash
cd native
cargo run --bin cosmicverge-server -- generate-assets ../web/static
```

To run the webserver:

```bash
cd native
cargo run --bin cosmicverge-server -- serve
```

Once the server is running, you only need to relaunch it if you change the server code. The web app will be reloaded from disk and cache-busting measures are taken to ensure the latest version is always presented.

You can access the game at: `http://localhost:7879/`
