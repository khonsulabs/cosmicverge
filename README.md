# Cosmic Verge

This project has been put on hold. For more information, [read at CosmicVerge.com][cv].

This branch contains what can eventually become the oxidized version of Cosmic
Verge. For the original prototype's source, see [branch
`production`](https://github.com/khonsulabs/cosmicverge/tree/production).

This branch is [automatically](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) deployed to
[CosmicVerge.com][cv]. It is nothing more than a static file server that is
being driven by [BonsaiDb](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb).

This is overkill for a static site, but it serves as a simple,
running-in-production example of how to use BonsaiDb as a basis for a web
application.
